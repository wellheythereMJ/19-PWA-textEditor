## PWA-textEditor

The Text Editor is a single-page application allowing users to create notes or code snippets both online and offline.

Using IndexedDB via the idb package for data storage, webpack for bundling, and service workers for offline functionality, this app ensures data persistence and a seamless user experience.

This application is deployed on Render, accessible here.
